# About me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Cognition and Decision Lab at Boston University. My main academic interests lie in exploring the value-modulatory effects of effort and delay, and the brain networks that underlie these processes. Accessory to these goals is my interest in using graph theoretic tools to compute subject-specific functional brain networks.
