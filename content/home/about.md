# About me

I'm a Data Scientist at Linus Health working on early prediction of neurodegenerative diseases. Before that I was a Research Fellow in Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, working in the Haber Lab at McLean. My doctoral work looked into the sources of individual variability that can get in the way of pinpointing where economic judgments arise in the brain. I then stepped from neuroimaging to neuroanatomy to get a more in depth understanding of the brain's reward circuitry. When I'm not thinking about the brain, I am either taking care of my daughter or listening to/playing music.
