# About me

I'm a Research Fellow at McLean Hospital and Harvard Medical School, working in the Haber Lab. My work involves aggregating brain data from non-human and human primates in order to understand how the brain generates the types of subjective value that we use to guide our choices. This endeavor mixes anatomical tracer and functional neuroimaging data that I analyze using graph theoretic and machine learning algorithms.
