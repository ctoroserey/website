      <description>Why are you doing this? There are enough secret santa services So, how does it work? Shiny implementation Closing   Why are you doing this? There are enough secret santa services Last Christmas my wife was left giftless on my side of the family due to a faulty secret santa generator. In trying to earn brownie points the arrogant nerd in me thought he could do better, so I decided to program one in R (I’d rather know exactly what’s going on in the background anyways).</description>

      <description>A bit of background The Rand Index The Adjusted Rand Index Closing   A bit of background A common need for researchers that rely on clustering algorithms, such as the organization of networks into cohesive node communities, is to evaluate the similarity of the partitions produced. In my case this problem takes the form of comparing the distribution of brain networks across individuals. While many tools have been developed to tackle the challenge (see Fortunato &amp;amp; Hric, 2016 for an initial survey), here I’ll give a superficial view on the adjusted rand index (ARI), hoping to better understand its behavior and ideal case usage.</description>

      <description>In a way, this is just a post to baptise the website. What I plan to do here from now on is to share snippets of what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned, read, or listened to lately (with a small dose of personal experiences), in hopes to both consolidate my knowledge and potentially help others. In a way, the picture of Boston in the header just represents that the overarching theme will be anything that has happened since I moved here for grad school (so yes, learning, reading, and listening to music mostly).</description>
